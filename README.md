## 🌟 Overview

**Story Architect Desktop** is an enterprise-grade visual narrative development environment designed for game writers, quest designers, and indie developers creating visual novels, text RPGs, and branching interactive fiction.

It combines the performance and security of **Rust (Tauri v2)** with a modern, responsive **React 19** canvas powered by `@xyflow/react`.

### 🔒 100% Local-First & Private
- **Zero Cloud Lock-in:** No mandatory accounts, telemetry, or external API servers.
- **Native File System Access:** Reads and writes atomic, version-controlled `.story.json` files directly to disk.
- **Air-Gapped Operation:** Runs completely offline after initial installation.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🗺️ Visual Node Canvas & Multi-Branching
- **Dynamic Choice Handles:** Dedicated output pins for each branching choice, eliminating overlapping lines even when multiple branches lead to the same scene.
- **Draggable Bezier Curves:** Freeform curvature control—drag any edge label to shape connector arcs around obstacles, with double-click reset.
- **Interactive Story Regions:** Group scenes into chapters/acts with resizable colored boundary containers (`<NodeResizer>`).
- **Chapter Navigator:** Jump-to-region timeline with smooth 800ms camera fly-to transitions (`fitBounds`) and `Ctrl + 1..9` hotkeys.

### 🎮 Built-in AAA Visual Novel Simulator
- **Immersive Testing Stage:** Fullscreen background rendering with cinematic radial vignetting.
- **Step-by-Step Dialogue Engine:** Clean glassmorphism dialogue box advancing one line at a time via `Space` / `Enter`.
- **Dynamic Variable & Condition Engine:** Live tracking of flags (boolean) and stats (numerical). Choices automatically evaluate logic gates (`[🔒 Requires: Gold >= 15]`) and lock unavailable branches.

### 🧰 Workflow & Productivity
- **Left Palette & Parking Stash:** Drag-and-drop node spawning precisely under the mouse cursor (`screenToFlowPosition`), plus an off-canvas holding area for drafting unused nodes.
- **Canvas Context Menu:** Right-click anywhere on the viewport for quick scene creation, autolayout, and zoom operations.
- **Standalone HTML Export:** Compiles the entire story, variables, dialogue, and media into a self-contained single-file `.html` game that runs in any web browser.
- **AI / MCP Bridge:** Integrated Model Context Protocol (WebSocket on `127.0.0.1:39123`) allowing local AI agents (Cline, Claude Desktop) to collaborate on the canvas in real time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your host system:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v22.12+ LTS or v24)
2. **[Rust](https://rustup.rs/)** (stable toolchain)
3. **Platform-Specific C++ Build Environment:**
   - **Windows:** Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (workload: *Desktop development with C++*) and **WebView2 Runtime** (pre-installed on Windows 10/11).
   - **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
   - **Linux:** Standard WebKit2GTK and build essentials (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `build-essential`, `curl`, `wget`, `file`, `libxdo-dev`, `libssl-dev`).

### Installation & Local Run

```powershell
# Navigate to the desktop project directory
cd story-architect-desktop

# Install pinned dependencies
npm ci

# Run the native desktop application in dev mode (Tauri + Vite)
npm run tauri:dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running `npm run dev` starts the frontend in standalone browser preview mode. Native file system dialogs, local MCP socket communication, and system window accelerators require `npm run tauri:dev`.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Code Quality

```powershell
# Run ESLint (0 errors, 0 warnings policy)
npm run lint

# Run store and graph geometry test suites
npm test

# Verify Rust library integration (cross-platform path)
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
```

---

## 📦 Production Build & Packaging

To compile optimized release binaries and generate platform installers:

```powershell
npm run tauri:build
```

On Windows, the compiled bundle artifacts will be written to:

```plaintext
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
├── nsis/
│   └── Story Architect_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe   # Standalone installer
└── msi/
    └── Story Architect_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi   # Windows Installer package
```

### Customizing Application Artwork

Application icons are generated from `app-icon.svg`. After updating the source vector artwork, regenerate platform icon sets using:

```powershell
npx tauri icon app-icon.svg
```
